                <p class="advice-answer">I would just say to follow the instructions for now and be prepared for the unexpected. Also, make sure you have all the right pieces because sometimes when ordering things online, not everything is included.</p>
                <p class="process-paragraph">Can you walk us through the process of building this guitar?</p>
                <p class="process-answer">We need to make sure everything fits in the right spot. Move the cables around and shield the guitar for optimal sound. Be careful not to break any strings when restringing the guitar</p>
                <p class="challenges-paragraph">What challenges did you face during this project, and how did you overcome them? How do you feel about the final result, and would you undertake this project again?</p>
                <p class="challenges-answer">
The challenge was that certain screws didnâ€™t have pre-drilled holes. I had to drill the holes myself and ensure that I was using the right screws. The directions were not very specific about which screws to use where, so figuring out the proper screws for each situation was challenging. Despite this, I like the final result and would do the project again</p>
