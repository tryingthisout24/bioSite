                <h2>Learning through the Human Experience</h2>
                <p>After interviewing Jordan, he shared a few projects he has been putting off for various reasons. He expressed a strong desire to finally see these projects through, as they require much creativity, and he is very excited about them. Jordan has always been a builder by nature. He loves tackling problems and finding solutions, something many of you may relate to.</p>
                <p class="second-paragraph">Jordan is about to take on two very different but equally intriguing projects. As a huge fan of classic rock and playing guitar, he is going to attempt to build his own electric guitar for the first time. Additionally, as a lover of sourdough bread, he will also try making sourdough bread from scratch. This website will showcase the chronological process and the end results of his attempts at both projects.</p>
