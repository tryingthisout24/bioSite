                            Like my dad, I have a love for woodworking and doing projects. Growing up, I watched him create amazing things and figure out DIY projects on his own, even before platforms like YouTube and Pinterest existed. I would often help him, even though he took on most of the work himself. As I got older and moved away, I still came by the house to help with certain projects. One day, I saw a guitar kit on Amazon. With my love for classic rock, I thought buying the kit would be a great project for us to work on together.

                            After mentioning it to him, he went into the garage the next weekend, drew out a design on a piece of wood, and researched how to build a guitar from scratch, while I was buying a kit online to piece together. My inspiration for building this guitar, although it's hard for me because my father passed away, is to feel a connection to him through the building process. It makes me feel like I am in his shoes in the garage, just once more.
